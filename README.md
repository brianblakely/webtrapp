# WebTrapp
Run a web app as a local executable.
You can report bugs and make feature requests [right over here](https://github.com/brianblakely/webtrapp/issues).

## How To Use

1. Download WebTrapp: [Windows]() | [Linux]() | [Mac]()

2. Place the WebTrapp executable into its own directory
   or, if you would like it to share a directory with other files,
   change the executable's filename.

3. Open WebTrapp and fill in each setting field (you only need to do this once).

## FAQ

* **Can I change my settings after the initial setup?**

You can modify the webtrapp.txt file that was created in the same directory
as your executable.

* **Can I use multiple WebTrapp executables?**

You certainly can, just download another.
If you want to place them all in the same directory,
make sure you **rename** each one before running it.

* **Can I use browser extensions with apps running in WebTrapp?**

No, but you can fork WebTrapp to add extensions for specific Web apps.
